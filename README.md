# Wang_et_al_2023_Acta_Neuro_Comms_Code
The following folders provide model code to perform the analyses described in the manuscript titled "Glioblastoma Pseudoprogression and True Progression Reveal Spatially Variable Transcriptional Differences" by Wang et al.

Please note gene expression data has been stored in GEO under studies GSE231994 (nCounter) and GSE232050 (GeoMx). Imaging data is available by request from authors. Code requires modification to run fully which includes: modifying the working directory, running analyses with nanostring software, and revising file names to reflect your naming scheme.

Code has been commented to assist in modification but please contact corresponding authors for questions. Most scripts are based on established workflows by EBImage, WGCNA, and etc. Please see referenced libraries for details.

For Fig 3 and 4 image analysis studies. Image processing code has been provided. However users may skip to Part 3-4 as processed image data files are available in repository. RDS/csv files are listed with integration of where they can be used to skip data processing steps.
